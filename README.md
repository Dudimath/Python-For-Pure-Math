## Overview

This repository contains solutions to the Python Assignment 1 for the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) Rwanda, Kigali. The assignment covers various fundamental Python programming tasks, including variable manipulation, control structures, input/output operations, and basic algorithms.

## Questions and Solutions

### Question 1: Understanding the Variables
This question involves evaluating the values of given variables after executing a series of assignments and arithmetic operations.

### Question 2: Print Triangle and Rectangle
Write Python code to print a rectangle and a triangle using asterisks.

### Question 3: Weight Conversion
Write a Python program that asks the user for weight in kilograms and converts it to pounds. There are 2.2 pounds in a kilogram.

### Question 4: Tip Calculator
Write a program that asks the user for the price of a meal and the percent tip they want to leave. Then print both the tip amount and the total bill with the tip included.

### Question 5: String Manipulation
Given two strings, return a new string made of the first, middle, and last characters of each string.

### Question 6: Expected Output of Code
Determine the output of a given code snippet involving variable scoping and function calls.

### Question 7: Print Sequence with Sep
Print multiples of a user-input number, separated by dashes.

### Question 8: Power Calculation
Generate a random number `x` between 1 and 50 and a random number `y` between 2 and 5, then compute `x` raised to the power of `y`.

### Question 9: Salary Bonus
Ask the user to enter their salary and calculate the bonus based on specified conditions.

### Question 10: Leap Year Checker
Write a program to check if a given year is a leap year.

### Question 11: Generating Discrete Intervals
Use a for loop and a while loop to generate discrete intervals between specified ranges.

### Question 12: Fibonacci Sequence
Find the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million.

## Code Examples

### Example: Printing a Triangle and Rectangle

```python
# Rectangle
print("***********")
print("*         *")
print("***********")

# Triangle
for i in range(1, 6):
    print('*' * i)
